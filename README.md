# Data Portability Compliance Project (Quebec Law 25)

This repository documents the project plan, execution approach, tools, and outcomes for a data portability solution designed for a Canadian bank to meet Quebec Law 25 (Bill 64) compliance requirements.

---

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Deliver a secure, API-based solution to export personal information (PI) on demand in a machine-readable format, mitigating potential penalties of up to $25M.
- **Duration:** 9 months
- **Approach:** Hybrid Agile (Agile sprints + Waterfall checkpoints)
- **Tools:** Jira, Confluence, MS Visio, Postman, ServiceNow

## Tech Stack

- Secure API Gateway
- Data Encryption Standards
- JSON format
- Legacy and Cloud-based Apps

---

## Role and Responsibility 
As the Program Manager, I was responsible for:
- End-to-end planning, delivery, and stakeholder management
- Aligning legal, cybersecurity, architecture, and business teams
- Managing a cross-functional delivery squad (BAs, developers, architects, testers)
- Coordinating vendor evaluations and solution integration efforts
- Overseeing secure API deployment and data standardization strategy
- Reporting to the Data Governance Steering Committee and Compliance Office

---

## Achievements/Results

- Delivered MVP in 6 months, full solution in 9 months
- Implemented secure API gateway and AES-256 encryption
- Reduced manual request handling time by ~80%
- Aligned business, legal, and IT stakeholders under a unified delivery plan

---

## Technical Awareness Demonstrated

- Understood PI data types and their distribution across on-prem and cloud systems
- Collaborated with Solution Architects on API design, payload schemas, and gateway security
- Navigated challenges related to data duplication, format standardization, and latency
- Led decision-making on using common data lake vs. federated access model
- Ensured encryption policies aligned with internal InfoSec and Bill 64 encryption guidelines
