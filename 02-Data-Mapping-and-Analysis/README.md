## Objective
- To identify where personal information (PI) resides and evaluate data accessibility across applications

## Activities performed during this phase
- Facilitated workshops with application owners to identify systems containing PI data
- Worked with Data Governance to classify PI elements (sensitive vs. general)
- Mapped 53+ systems and documented data structures and overlaps
- Conducted feasibility assessment for centralized vs federated access

## Key steps:
After conducting the workshops with Legal, Privacy, and App Owners to scope PI data,
1. Mapped 53 systems to identify if PI resided in common databases or was fragmented
2. Used data classification matrix to prioritize which PI elements were critical
3. Facilitated architecture working groups to design:
    - A common database ingestion model (when feasible)
    - Orchestrated on-demand data pull via secured APIs (when data was decentralized)
    - Implemented encryption standards (AES-256) and routing through secure API gateways
    - Delivered testable JSON outputs to simulate real customer/employee requests

## Key Deliverables
- Application Inventory Spreadsheet
- PI Data Classification Matrix
- System-to-System Data Map
- Gap Analysis Summary
